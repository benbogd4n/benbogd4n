- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @benbogd4n
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in automation, security and creating problem solving solutions.
- ðŸ’¼ I am currently completing an IT traineeship with a focus on automation and operations. During this traineeship I learned Python and Bash scripting, cloud fundamentals, SQL and cybersecurity basics.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also self-taught in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have expanded my frontend knowledge with learning the Vue.js framework, which I also used to create my portfolio site.
